# Aquarium Protocol Base
Consolidated general purpose libraries for biology protocols in Aquarium.

This repo will contain libraries that:
- Are general enough that they could be used in any biology protocol
- Don't contain references to a specific lab, protocol, or workflow, unless the protocol is provided as part of a general-purpose kit such as for miniprep or site-directed mutagenesis
- Don't contain any `protocol.rb` or associated files, except ones for demo or testing of a library

See the [project board](https://github.com/aquariumbio/protocol-base/projects/1) for the work plan.
