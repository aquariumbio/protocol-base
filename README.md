# Standard libraries required by many workflows written for the UW BIOFAB and Klavins Lab

## About this repository 
This repository contains two sets of files:
- One, with files located in `standard_libs` and `test`, is managed by [pfish](https://github.com/klavinslab/pfish).
- One, located in all other folders, is managed by [Aquarium's built-in export function](https://www.aquarium.bio/?category=Community&content=Exporting). 

Documentation is generated by the built-in export function and updated manually.
