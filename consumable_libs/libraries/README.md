# [Consumable Libs](https://github.com/aquariumbio/protocol-base/tree/main/consumable_libs/libraries)

These libraries work along with the [Composition](https://github.com/aquariumbio/protocol-base/tree/main/composition_libs) libraries.  It follows the same rules and patters except with laboratory consumables.  Consumables have no real concept in Aquarium so there will be no associated Item or other Aquarium object.
